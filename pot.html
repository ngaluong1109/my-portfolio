                <p>
                    The event will offer an opportunity for participants of all ages to showcase their creativity by painting tree pots. We will provide plain clay pots, paint brushes, acrylic paints, and other necessary art supplies for participants to use during the event. To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience, we will set up designated painting stations to prevent any accidental paint spills on clothing.

<br>To add an element of friendly competition, we propose a "Most Beautiful Painting" contest. At the end of the event, a panel of judges, comprising members of our organization and art enthusiasts from the community, will evaluate the painted tree pots and select the participant with the most beautiful painting. The winner will be awarded a special gift as recognition of their artistic talent and contribution to the event.
